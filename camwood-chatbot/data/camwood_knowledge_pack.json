      { "q": "Can you give me an example of 'Clarity in Motion'?", "a": "Certainly. Imagine a large retailer trying to manage supply chain logistics.

That's turning complexity into clear, actionable intelligence." },
      { "q": "What kind of data does Camwood handle?", "a": "We handle a wide range of data types, including structured data from databases, unstructured data like text and images, and streaming data from real-time sources.
